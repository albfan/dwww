    README for dwww
                              ``To boldly go where no doc has gone before''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

dwww is a web interface to all on-line documentation on a
Debian system.  It builds some web pages that list all installed
documents, and converts all documents to HTML. The conversion
is done when the user requests the document.  A future version
will support several ways of searching for documents.

dwww requires running a web server. Sorry.

For more information, read the manual page dwww(8), and the other
manual pages it refers to.


  Automatic fancy index of documents
--------------------------------------

Debian now has a "doc-base" package that provides a uniform way of
registering documenation; it supports other documentation systems besides 
dwww. Please read install-docs(8) for futher reference.

	    dwww is still under development!

dwww is already quite usable, however.  Please use it, and report
bugs via the Debian bug tracking system so that they can be fixed.

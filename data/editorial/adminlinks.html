<h1>Documents for system administrators</h1>

This page contains some links to documents that are of use for system
administrators.  Not all of the documents are necessarily installed.<p>

Sysadmins should look especially at manual page 
<a href="man-in-section-8.html">section 8</a>.
The LDP books Network Administrators' Guide and System Administrators'
Guide (draft) are important.
<p>

<h2>Software installation</h2>

	The Debian package management tools are
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=dselect/8">dselect</a>,
	and 
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=dpkg/8">dpkg</a>.
	With them, it is quite simple to install, upgrade, and uninstall
	programs.
	<p>
	
	For programs installed from source, you usually need to use
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=make/1">make</a>
	or
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=imake/1x">imake</a>.
	You may need some programming skills to compile some programs,
	if they haven't been ported to Linux already.  Read the README
	or other documentation for each package for closer details.
	<p>

<h2>Backups and archives</h2>

	Traditional tools for making backups are
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=tar/1">tar</a>,
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=cpio/1">cpio</a>, and
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=dump/8">dump</a>.
	Also available for Debian are 
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=afio/1">afio</a>,
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=tob/1">tob</a>, and
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=taper/1">taper</a>.
	These tools can also be used for archiving.  They're mostly intended
	for tape drives.
	<p>
	
<h2>User administration</h2>

	Users are created with
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=adduser/8">adduser</a>,
	groups with
	<a href="/cgi-bin/dwww?type=man&amp;location=addgroup/8">addgroup</a>.
	There are currently no good tools for removing either, you have
	to edit /etc/passwd and /etc/group by hand.<p>
	
	In Debian, each user `foo' has his own group `foo'.
	Most other Unix systems are different.  You may want to read
	<a href="per-user-group-reason.html">the reason for this</a>.<p>

<h1>Introduction to documentation on Debian</h1>

This document is an overview of the different kinds of documentation that
are available on-line on a Debian GNU/Linux system.  The same kinds of 
documentation is available on all Linux and most UNIX systems as well.<p>

Most of the documentation is targeted at the user of a specific program,
command, or library function, but there are also some more general
tutorials.  The documents come as manual pages, Info files, plain
text files, HTML files, and in various other formats.  The Debian on-line
documentation system gives access to all of them via a WWW browser
by converting the documents to HTML, if possible.<p>


<h2><a name="man"></a>Manual pages</h2>

Manual pages are the traditional form of UNIX documentation.  Each command,
library function, special file, and so on, has a separate ``page'' of 
documentation.  The manual pages follow a common format, with named
sections.

	<dl>
	<dt>NAME
	<dd>The name of the command or commands (one manual page sometimes
		documents several commands), and a short summary of what
		the command does (only a few words).
	<dt>SYNOPSIS or SUMMARY
	<dd>A terse description of what options and arguments the command has.
		For an experienced user, the synopsis is often enough to
		see how to use the command.
	<dt>DESCRIPTION
	<dd>The detailed description of the command.
	<dt>OPTIONS
	<dd>What each of the options means.  Sometimes this is not a
		separate section, but is included in the description.
	<dt>ERRORS
	<dd>What the program does is various error situations.
	<dt>FILES
	<dd>Important files that the program uses.
	<dt>SEE ALSO
	<dd>Other manual pages or documents that you might also want to
		read.
	<dt>BUGS
	<dd>Problems and restrictions in the program that you should be
		aware of.
	</dl>
	
Many manual pages contain many other sections, and few include all of
the above.<p>

Manual pages make it possible to find information quickly.  The manual
pages form the UNIX reference manual, but they are not very useful
if you haven't used a UNIX system before.  Most manual pages assume that
you understand the common concepts of using UNIX.  You should start by 
reading a tutorial (see below).  Then, when you need to learn a new
command, you can read its manual page.<p>

Manual pages are read with the <code>man</code> command.  You give the
name of the manual page (usually the same as the command) as the
argument.  For example, to read the manual page for the <code>ls</code>
command, you'd give the following command: 
	<blockquote>
	<code>man ls</code>
	</blockquote>
You can also read manual pages using your WWW browser
through the Debian on-line documentation system. 

<h2><a name="info"></a>Info files</h2>

The GNU Project uses the Texinfo system to produce manuals. Texinfo is
a markup language, and produces either printed manuals (using the TeX
typesetting system), or on-line manuals in <em>Info</em> format.
Info files are a simple form of hypertext. They are usually structured
like like books, and are usually larger than manual pages.<p>

Few people outside the GNU Project use Texinfo, but since GNU has produced
so much software, there are many Info files.  Since a manual page should
be short, and an Info file need not be, the Info files are sometimes easier
to read.<p>

Info files can be read directly using the GNU Emacs help system
(started with <code>C-h i</code> from within Emacs), or the standalone
Info browser (started with <code>info</code> from the shell).
You can also read manual pages using your WWW browser
through the info2www interface that comes with the 
Debian on-line documentation system.<p>

<h2><a name="other"></a>Other document formats</h2>

Most programs come with a ``README'' file, which is a simple text file,
often called README that describes the program and often includes
instructions on how to install it. The README is usually not important
for people who use the program, but it can be interesting to read it
if you want to know how things work. On a Debian system, the README's,
and other similar files, are installed in a package specific directory,
under <code>/usr/share/doc</code> (see below).<p>

It is becoming more common for complicated programs to include documentation
in HTML or Postscript format, in addition to (sometimes incomplete) manual
pages.  HTML is the markup language that WWW uses, and all such documents
are easily accessible via the Debian on-line documentation system.
Postscript, however, is a complicated typesetting language, and it cannot
easily be converted to other formats.  There is no easy way to read
the Postscript manuals via the Debian on-line documentation system.<p>


<h2><a name="ldp"></a>The Linux Documentation Project</h2>

Since 1993, the Linux Documentation Project has produced FAQ's and
HOWTO's and books to explain how to install and use Linux.
The LDP books have been converted to HTML, but are not currently available
as Debian packages, and cannot therefore be read through the Debian
on-line documentation system. <p>

<h2><a name="finding"></a>Finding documents on a Debian system</h2>

Manual pages are typically stored under <code>/usr/share/man</code>,
and <code>/usr/local/man</code>. Each
manual page is in its own file. They are written using an old
markup language (see documentation for <code>groff</code> and the
<code>mandoc</code> macros), and are formatted into a more readable
format using <code>nroff</code>. Since the formatting can be slow, the
formatted page is stored into <code>/var/catman</code>; that directory
is automatically cleaned from old formatted versions.<p>

Info documents are stored in <code>/usr/share/info</code>.  Info files are
not quite plain text, so they also need to be formatted for easier reading.
However, this formatting is fast enough that the formatted version is
not saved.<p>

Each installed Debian package creates its own documentation directory
below <code>/usr/share/doc</code>.  For example, documentation for Debian
itself is in <code>/usr/share/doc/debian</code>.  All documentation that is
not manual pages of Info files is stored in the package's documentation
directory.<p>

The <code>/usr/share/common-licenses</code> directory contains the common 
copyright statements like GPL, and <code>/usr/share/doc/<package>/examples</code> contains
example configurations and programs.<p>

<h2><a name="suggest"></a>Suggested reading order</h2>

If you're new to UNIX-like systems, you should probably start with
Matt Welsh's <a href="xxx">Installation and Getting Started</a>.
It includes much information about installing Linux, but that part
is not relevant for a Debian system.  However, the book also includes
introductions on how to use Linux, and you should read those to get
a feel for what using UNIX is like.<p>

At some point, you should read the manual pages for your shell
(<a href="foo">bash</a>), and some of the essential file handling
commands
(<a href="foo">ls</a>,
<a href="foo">less</a>,
<a href="foo">cd</a>,
<a href="foo">mkdir</a>,
<a href="foo">rmdir</a>,
<a href="foo">cp</a>,
<a href="foo">mv</a>,
<a href="foo">rm</a>).  You might also want to check out
<a href="foo">Midnight Commander</a> and
<a href="foo">GNU Interactive Tools</a>, which can be nicer to
use than the traditional commands.  Also read the manual for your
editor (for example,
<a href="foo">Pico</a>,
<a href="foo">ae</a>,
<a href="foo">Emacs</a>,
<a href="foo">Jed</a>,
<a href="foo">vim</a>,
<a href="foo">nvi</a>, or
<a href="foo">elvis</a>, depending on taste and on what is installed).
After that, browse the Debian on-line documentation system and read
about whatever happens to interest you.<p>

<h1>Manual page sections</h1>

<p>UNIX manual pages are divided into eight sections or chapters.  Each
section covers a specific area.  Section 9 is a Linux addition. Some
sections have subsections, indicated by some letters after the section
number. For example, manual pages for X programs are in section 1x.

<ul>
<li><a href="man-in-section-1.html">Section 1: User commands.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-2.html">Section 2: System calls.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-3.html">Section 3: Library functions.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-4.html">Section 4: Device files.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-5.html">Section 5: File formats.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-6.html">Section 6: Games.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-7.html">Section 7: Miscellaneous.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-8.html">Section 8: System administration.</a>
<li><a href="man-in-section-9.html">Section 9: Kernel functions.</a>
</ul>

dwww (1.10.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dwww no longer touches links in the request HTML files, but just passes
    them unchanged. This allows embedded javascript to work correctly (see
    Bug#265573) and of course is more efficient.

  * Because of the above change and broken handling of the CGI specification
    by the BOA and THTTPD web servers, dwww WON'T WORK correctly with them!
    (see Bug#164306 and Bug#365763)

  * dwww generates its pages directly in the /var/www/ (or other dir
    specified with DWWW_DOCROOTDIR variable) instead of creating links.

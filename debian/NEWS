dwww (1.11.1) unstable; urgency=low

    New design of the dwww-generated web pages introduced in 1.11.0.
    Thanks to Harold Melton (kv5r at kv5r.com), now the pages have light
    peach background menu bar, and larger mono face fonts for the man pages,
    much more suitable for the newer LCD monitors with sub-pixel anti-aliasing.

    The layout can be customised by a user, please see dwww(7) for details.

dwww (1.10.0) unstable; urgency=low

    dwww no longer touches links in the request HTML files, but just passes
    them unchanged. This allows embedded javascript to work correctly (see
    Bug#265573) and of course is more efficient.

    Because of the above change and broken handling of the CGI specification
    by the BOA and THTTPD web servers, dwww WON'T WORK correctly with them!
    (see Bug#164306 and Bug#365763)

    dwww generates its pages directly in the /var/www/ (or other dir
    specified with DWWW_DOCROOTDIR variable) instead of creating links.

dwww (1.8.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove DWWW_SERVERTYPE and automatic searching for installed web servers.
    Now dwww doesn't try to guess DWWW_DOCROOTDIR, DWWW_CGIDIR, and other
    variables. You have to set them by hand (with debconf or by editing
    /etc/dwww/dwww.conf (closes: #157023).
    Rationale: We have almost 20 different web servers in Debian. It's very
    hard to handle them all, and probably it's not even needed since most
    of them uses default settings as required by the Debian Policy.
    Updated flies: debian/{dwww.config, dwww.postinst, dwww.templates*}.

  * dwww-convert:
    + If requested file does not exist, check for file with suffix ".en"
      (closes: #117781).
    + Introduced distinction between
        type=file&location=/path/to/directory (shows index.htm* file if exists)
      and
        type=dir&file=/path/to/directory (shows contents of the directory).
    + If file extension starts with a number, and file path contains "/man/",
      assume it is a man page.

  * dwww-build:
    + Don't use subdirectory of /var/cache/dwww (which can be removed by a
      local admin) for temporary files; use `tmpfile' command instead.
    + man_by_section_index: If we have man pages in section Nxxx, but not in
      section N, force section N to be listed (e.g. 9gii and 9).
    + Add `set -e'.
    + Remove unneeded (and already commented out) parts of code.

  * dwww: added elinks to TXT_BROWSERS.

  * Standards-Version: 3.5.7
  * Build with debhelper v4.
  * Handle DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt,nostrip (and as my addition: nodebug)

    + Fixed the bad_symlink function (closes: #154801).
    Many thanks for your help, Daniel!

  * dwww-convert:
    + Added ErrorMsg function for better handling of errors.
    + If a file doesn't exist, check with badfile() if the file would be
      under some directory in DWWW_DOCPATH, and if yes -  show
      "File not found" error message instead of "Access denied".

  * dwww-find: fixed broken regexp in apropos handling function
    (closes: #155188).
  * I can't reproduce the "Use of uninitialised value ..." bug, probably
    it was a debconf bug (closes: #137254).

  * Upload to woody, no changes in source.
    The current dwww version in woody is 1.7.4, but I'd like to see 1.7.6
    there: it has fixed a few of bugs and no new bug has been reported

dwww (1.7.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It seems the boa web server sets strange umask (0177) and closes stderr

    messages to .cache_db and than segfaulted on such broken database file.
    To fix the problem (closes: #134382):
    + functions.sh: added dwww_initialize function, which i.a. sets default
      umask 022 for all dwww scripts.
    + added utils.c with dwww_initialize, which sets umask and reopens stdin,
      stdout and stderr.
    + dwww-cache.c: s/sprintf/snprintf/ almost all.

  * dwww-convert:
    + builtin_html2html no longer uses DWWW_SERVERNAME when converting
      anchors. Now it outputs anchors like "/cgi-bin/dwww....", not
      "http://$DWWW_SERVERNAME/cgi-bin/dwww..." (closes: #112843).
    + it also converts <APPLET ARCHIVE=""> links.
    + correctly handles case when type=dir and location=/path/to/not/dir.

  * dwww-quickfind rewritten, now it stores informations about packages,
    not only programs (closes: #132000).
    + removed an item from TODO, updated dwww(1) man page.

  * dwww.template: rewritten by William Clifford <wobh@yahoo.com>, so it now
    uses CSS and validates with w3's html validator.
    Thanks, William!

  * cron.daily/dwww: set maxdepth in find expression to 2, so now cache dir
    will get cleaned.

dwww (1.7.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dwww-txt2html partially rewritten to adds anchors for more types of URIs:
    + http and ftp sites (e.g. ftp.somewhere.com)
    + mail addresses (foo@bar.com)
    + documentation references in /usr{/|/share|/local}/{doc|man} dirs
    + `closes #bug_no' statements
  * Option --man is ignored, dwww-txt2html converts manual page references in
    all documents.

  * Cache also text/plain documents.
  * Added new file /usr/share/dwww/functions.sh with common functions.

  * Do better output formatting using <TABLE> tags in dwww-find and function
    builtin_dir2html from dwww-convert.
  * dwww-convert:builtin_man2html now displays man pages which contains '.so'
    requests like lastb(1).
  * dwww-convert: added /usr/share/common-licenses/ to DWWW_DOCPATH.

  * dwww.cgi, dwww-convert: handle filenames with spaces like "Readme
    Win32.txt" in /usr/share/doc/overkill.

  * Ups, dwww-format-man got broken in 1.7.0 :(. Now is OK, I think.
  * Updated dwww-txt2html(8) and some other man pages.
  * Removed items about packaging style from TODO file.

dwww (1.7.0) unstable; urgency=low

    + when a document is stored in the cache, set its mtime to mtime of
      original file.
    + create lock on cache database with flock.
    + added DWWW_USE_CACHE variable, so cache mechanism can be turned off
      if somebody doesn't like it.
    + action --store does not only store file in the cache, but also it
      outputs the file into the stdout.
    + cached documents are stored in subdirectories.
    + minor other modifications.
  * Applied patch from Chris Tillman (closes: #126851).
  * dwww-format-man: su to $DWWW_USER.

  * Drop support for .dwww-index files, dwww-doc-index script removed too.
      (closes: #67739)
  * The menu method is now only method of generating documentation's index,
    so increased dependency on a menu package from `Recommends:' to `Depends:'.
  * Updated README file.

  * Debconf support added, old dwwwconfig script removed. New debconf
    config script should fix the problems listed below:
      + "dwww produces lots of output at installation time"    (closes: #11897)
      + "dwww postinstall emits diagnostic but does not fail!" (closes: #29272)
      + "dwwwconfig does not honour SERVERTYPE setting..."     (closes: #62605)

  * dwww-build, dwww.cgi, dwww-text2html: do proper URL encoding.

  * Include /var/www/dwww symlink in the package as /var/www is a standard
    Debian `web document root' (closes: #9365).
  * The above mentioned symlink must be absolute (because /var/www can be
    a symlink itself), so override lintian complains about that.

  * Standards-Version: 3.5.4

dwww (1.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dwww-convert: Applied patch from Jean-Philippe Guerard
    <jean-philippe.guerard@mail.dotcom.fr>:
    + Several fixes in the HTML URLs conversion Perl script used in
      "dwww-convert". Should now correctly handle all URLs, including
      fragments, links splited over several lines, and unquoted URLs.
    + The HTML URLs conversion code used in "dwww-convert" is now in the
      "builtin_html2html" subroutine.
    + The HTML URLs conversion code in "dwww-convert" now handle
      <FRAME SRC=""> tags (closes: #11535).
    + In "dwww-convert", when trying to find out the file type, the file
      extension is checked to guess the file type, then, if unsuccessful,
      the "file" command is used (closes: #62735).
  Many thanks for the patch, Jean.

  * dwww-convert: minor other improvements.
  * debian/postinst: dwww's database is built in the background (closes: #8907).

  * Fixes in menu-method:
    + make it compatible with menu-2 (closes: #37378).
    + add "runonlyasroot" option (closes: #51206).
    + add support for external links with "url" entry (closes: #14041).

  * dwww-build: do not call update-menus. There is no such need since every
    package which provides menu entry file, should call updates-menu in its
    postinst script (closes: #29502, #54694, #64263, #77331).

  * Closing NMU fixed bugs: closes:  #8940, #10042, #10756, #17478, #19054,

dwww (1.4.3.2-0.1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix use of /tmp for tempfiles in a lot of places: tempfiles are now
    created in /var/spool/dwww.  Also fixed earlier "fix" that used
    /var/lib/dwww for tempfiles.  This should fix the errors from various
    dwww-* tools that also caused cron.daily/dwww to send a daily complaint
    mail to root.  (Bug#16212)
  * Install the dwww cgi script in /usr/lib/cgi-bin instead of /usr/lib/dwww.
    Changed dwwwconfig to create a copy instead of a symlink of the dwww cgi

     - don't compress copyright file;
     - do compress man pages;  (Bug#15706)

dwww (1.4.2-1) stable; urgency=high

    * Another CGI security bug that allowed execution of arbitrary
      commands.  I am now specifying a set of acceptable characters, rather
      than excluding certain ones and using perl -T.  Fixes bug #18107
      (Thanks to Martin Bialasinksi)
    * I know there are lots of other non-security bugs outstanding.  They will
      be fixed in an upcoming, more substantial release.
    * Compiled for libc5 for bo-updates.

dwww (1.4.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * libc6 compile
  * non-maintainer release
  * changed filelist="/tmp/dwww-find.list.$$" in dwww-find to
    filelist="/var/lib/dwww/find.list.$$" (Fixes: Bug#11830)

dwww (1.4.1-1) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed major security flaw: dwww.cgi would accept backquotes
    and '$' characters, then pass them on to bash.  This enables
    people to execute commands as the CGI user.  Particularily
    dangerous if someone configures their web server to run
    CGI programs as root. dwww.cgi was modified to convert all
    backquotes and dollar signs into underscores.
  * dwww.cgi: don't convert '+' characters into spaces - fixes
    bug #8563 (Thanks Lars Wirzenius and Joost Witteveen)
  * dwwwconfig: place quotes around DWWW_SERVERTYPE in
    /etc/dwww/dwww.conf to cope with server names with space
    such as CERN httpd - fixes bug #8525
  * /etc/cron.daily/dwww: added line to cd to /var/spool/dwww
    to prevent error message that someone was having (not me)
    - fixed bug #8591

dwww (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added emacs lines to changelog

    only .html was supported)
    (Thanks to Susan G. Kleinmann)
  * dwww-convert: properly handles files that do not exist
  * dwww-convert: checks for a .html.gz file if a .html file does
    not exist, and vice-versa
    (Thanks to Brian C. White)
  * dwww-convert: modified perl code in script to do replacements
    over the entire HTML file instead of doing it line by line
  * added full path to dwww-cache in /etc/cron.daily/dwww
    (Thanks to Herbert Xu for reporting the bug, and Henrik
    Wallin for the fix) - fixes bug #7088
  * made fixes to dwww-find and dwww-doc-index to make dwww work
    with bash 2.0 - fixes bugs #7103, #7143 and #7156
    (Thanks to Szymon M. Rusinkiewicz and Joey Hess)
  * dwww-convert: fixed small bug which confused newlines with
    contents of href tags
  * dwww-convert: recognize when filename is a directories.  It it
    is, then check for index.htm* files, and display them as
    standard files if found.  Removed code from
    builtin_dir2html() that would display index.htm* files.
  * dwww-convert: optimized builtin_dir2html() by using new
    feature of accessing directories using 'file' type.  Removed
    sed scripts.  Massive performance boost.  :-)
  * dwww-convert: fixed builtin_dir2html() to do file links to
    all types of *.htm* files when using DWWW_USEFILEURL
  * dwww-convert: added code to check for .htm, .html, .htm.gz,
    and .html.gz files when file not found.  Also, strip off
    HTML anchors.
  * Makefile, debian/rules: reworked directories, added
    /var/lib/dwww/html.  Changed documentation files to be mode
    0644.  Removed sticky bit from /var/spool/dwww directory and
    removed /var/spool/dwww/.cache_db file.
  * dwww-doc-index: changed function names to be compatible with
    sh and bash - fixes bug #7267
    (Thanks Bill Wohler)
  * adminlinks.htm, docintro.html, search-docs.html: removed these
    incomplete .html files to ./lib/editorial directory
  * dwww-build, dwww.template: Make more lynx friendly -- build man
    page indexes in separate directories.  Put search engine first.
    Remove link to docintro.html (it's incomplete).  Add link to
    menu.html.
  * dwww, dwww-build, dwww.1, dwww.8, postinst:  Change location of
    main index page from http://localhost/dwww/dwww.html to
    http://localhost/dwww/index.html.
  * dwww-build, html templates: modified so that there are new
    indexes to the man pages, and they are in separate directories
    (much like how Yahoo is set up).
  * dwww-build, dwww.8: Make title configurable.
  * Added Joost Witteveen's Debian Documentation Menu (Thanks!).
  * change location for /etc/dwww.conf to /etc/dwww/dwww.conf
  * control: added Recommends: menu (>= 0.11)
  * dwwwconfig, Makefile, rules: moved dwwwconfig from debian
    directory in source to main directory
  * added /var/www/dwww and /usr/lib/cgi-bin/dwww symlinks - to
    conform to web standard
  * removed INSTALL.Debian file and removed many items from to do
    list
  * dwww-build: modified it to create index files for wn web server

  * Removed references to localhost in dwww.template
  * Replaced references to file://localhost with
    reference to '/cgi-bin/dwww?type=file\&location=/usr/doc'
  * modified dwww-doc-index so that it doesn't complain if
    /usr/local/doc doesn't exist
  * added Perl code to dwww-convert to make links in html
    files point to cgi-script
  * added MIME headers to dwww-convert and removed them
    from cgi-script
  * added DWWW_SERVERNAME, DWWW_CGIUSER, and DWWW_USEFILEURL

    DWWW_SERVERNAME instead of localhost
  * if DWWW_USEFILEURL is set, revert back to old behaviour
    of using file:// URL's for performance
  * modified dwww-build so that it doesn't complain about
    directories in the manpath that don't exist
  * modified dwww-daily (/etc/cron.daily/dwww) to use

dwww (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer, Jim Pick <jim@jimpick.com>

    /usr/sbin directory - this should fix bugs #5604, #5674, #5785

    owner of that file - fixes bug #5603

 -- Jim Pick <jim@jimpick.com>  Sun, 15 Dec 1996 23:25:55 -0800

dwww (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added debian/* into upstream source. This changelog now works for
    upstream source as well.
  * Moved dwwwconfig into debian/dwwwconfig.
  * Added /usr/local/doc and /usr/share/doc into dwww front page.
  * Fixed dwww-cache's --list and --list-all show that they don't show
    out-of-date documents.
  * Changed "Package specific directories" into a normal "dir" request
    to dwww.cgi. This makes new packages immediately visible.
  * Removed "Copyrights" and "Examples" from front page. They're now
    inside package specific directories.
  * Added a C program to convert text to HTML. Much faster than the old
    sed jungle, and works better, too. Does manual pages too. However,
    doesn't remove headers and footers yet (and the old shell script
    code was buggy, so I removed it).
  * Removed package specific directory listing and copyrights from
    front page (and dwww-build). The latter is no longer needed, the
    former is better done with dir2html and caching.
  * Removed support for Info files (use info2www instead, since it
    actually works).
  * Removed support for compressed files in the cache. It slowed things
    too much, and wasn't all that useful, unless you were _really_
    short on disk space.
  * Fixed bug in dwww-quickfind: now searching for "sh" doesn't find
    tkdesksh (for example), but always finds something that ends in
    /sh, i.e., /bin/sh. Still a problem if there is both a /bin/sh
    and a /usr/bin/sh.
  * dwww-quickfind: Reads output of "dpkg --search '*'" instead of
    /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.list. This gives more portability, but makes
    dwww-daily somewhat slower. Only looks at files that contain
    /bin/, /sbin/, /usr/games/, for speed reasons.
  * dwww-cache: strip unnecessary .html end from files in /var/spool/dwww.
  * Added dwww-format-man: batch format manual pages into the cache.
  * Added dependency on man, for obvious reasons.
  * Added lists of documents (dwww-doc-linux).
  * Added GPL as file COPYING.
  * Fixed man-sections.html.
  * dwww-cache: Added prefix compression.
  * dwww-build: fixed suffix removal from name (in.telnetd.8 used to
    result in "in", now in "in.telnetd")
  * dwww-build: doesn't find non-English manual pages (because they
    make lists confusing; a future version will create separate lists
    for each language)

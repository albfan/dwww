Some notes on customizing DWWW with css. Rev. 26 Nov. 2008 -- 7 Jan. 2009

My css and other changes are not copyrighted, and should these changes be
incorporated into the DWWW package(s), such are a contribution and fall under 
the existing GPL for DWWW. I ask that my link kv5r.com remain in the css file.

Purpose: Update DWWW to HTML 4.01 Strict and CSS2 standards, improve 
appearance and usability, and make it easy to customize via css.

DWWW's output is themed by the css, including processed man pages.
Info pages are themed if my modified info2www is used.
Debian docs are not themed (that'd be a rather gigantic project).

Overview of mods to DWWW 1.10.15:
* Added css file manuals.css
* Change most dwww template files in /usr/share/dwww
* Minor changes in /cgi-bin/dwww (commented therein)
   and a customized /cgi-bin/info2www for use with dwww's new css (not cmtd),
* Minor changes to /usr/sbin/dwww-build (to copy the css file);
* Minor changes in dwww-build-menu, -find, -convert, and Utils.pm (output-related).
* Changed iso-8859-1 to UTF-8 in all files, for compatibility with some
   of the newer documentation (some were displaying wacky characters).
* Logos: created a ubuntu.png; recreated a better debian.png.

CSS file manuals.css is in the templates directory /usr/share/dwww, and it
gets copied to {webserver}/dwww by dwww-build -- edit the css in 
/usr/share/dwww then run dwww-build (or copy it manually), else editing the
copy in /var/www/dwww it'll get overwritten by the next dwww cron event.

The logos (either debian or ubuntu) png files are also copied; logo is set
in the body descriptor in the css file, as a page background image. Note that
long titles on narrow displays may overlap the logo -- if this is a problem,
the logo will need to be moved to the headers in the template files.
Logo files should be 150x40 px, transparent bg png. dwww-build copies *.png,
so other file formats won't work.

The CSS file includes some extras that are not used, but may be if desired.

Template files rewritten to HTML 4.01 Strict, UTF-8, en_us.
This means:
* removing all deprecated tag attribs such as FONT, ALIGN, etc.
* lowercasing all tags
* adding appropriate css hooks to divs, etc.
Note that XHTML was not used, as it is will soon be deprecated, and serves no 
useful purpose. (HUH? See http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml)

Various html formatting was removed from the templates and the cgi script,
such as <br><hr><br> as these are handled with margin and border-bottom
in the css. Also fixed Utils.pm table functions to make compliant markup. 

Anomaly: The file dwww.man.template does not seem to be used. Remove?

The manuals.css file may be copied and renamed into any doc directories whose 
html files include a css file link, to improve their appearance.

<h1>Search Debian documentation</h1>

<p>This page lets you search for documents containing one or more words.
By default, all documents are searched, but you can restrict this by
selecting one or more classes of documents.  Selections for manual pages
are additive: if you select both manual page section 1, and manual pages 
beginning with A, the search covers only those manual pages in section 1 
that begin with A.  Selections for Info and other documents are not
additive.

<p>Enter the words to search for: ................................
